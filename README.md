## Project Overview

Credit risk modelling is a crucial task in the financial industry, helping institutions assess the risk associated with loan distribution. This project develops a multi-class risk classification system using XGBoost to accurately assess loan distribution risks. The system uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and various statistical tests to enhance feature selection and improve model performance.

### Key Contributions:

- **Risk Classification:** Multi-class classification system to categorize customers into different risk levels.
- **Feature Selection:** EDA and statistical tests (Chi-square, ANOVA, VIF) used to select the most relevant features.
- **Model Performance:** Achieved F1 Scores of 0.79 for low-risk and 0.64 for high-risk customer classification.

## Features

- **Multi-class Risk Classification:** Categorizes customers into low, medium, and high-risk groups.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies patterns and insights in the dataset.
- **Statistical Tests for Feature Selection:** Uses Chi-square, ANOVA, and VIF to select important features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using F1 scores and other metrics.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
  - XGBoost, RandomForest, Decision-Tree (for classification)
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
  - Statsmodels (Chi-Square, ANOVA) (for statistical tests)
  
## Results

The model's performance was evaluated on a dataset of loan distribution risks. The multi-class classification system achieved the following F1 Scores:

- **Low-risk Customers:** F1 Score of 0.79
- **High-risk Customers:** F1 Score of 0.64

### Performance Highlights:

- **Effective Feature Selection:** Using EDA and statistical tests significantly improved model performance.
- **Accurate Risk Classification:** The system successfully classifies customers into different risk categories.
